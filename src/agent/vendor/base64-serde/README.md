This project provides a way to use [rust-base64](https://github.com/alicemaz/rust-base64) to serialize bytes with [serde](https://serde.rs/). This is a stopgap solution until [serde#1059](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/1059) is fixed.

For a running example, see the [integration tests](/tests/tests.rs).

The project is dual licensed under your preference of COIL 0.5 or Apache 2.0.
