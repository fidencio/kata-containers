-Introduction
-------------
-
-In Field Scan (IFS) is a hardware feature to run circuit level tests on
-a CPU core to detect problems that are not caught by parity or ECC checks.
-
-IFS Image
----------
-
-Intel will provide a firmware file containing the scan tests via
-github [#f1]_.  Similar to microcode there is a separate file for each
-family-model-stepping. The tests in the file are divided into some number
-of "chunks" that can be run individually.
-
-IFS Image Loading
------------------
-
-The driver loads the tests into memory reserved BIOS local to each CPU
-socket in a two step process using writes to MSRs to first load the
-SHA hashes for the test. Then the tests themselves. Status MSRs provide
-feedback on the success/failure of these steps. When a new test file
-is installed it can be loaded with::
-
-  # echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/ifs/reload
-
-Triggering tests
-----------------
-
-Tests are run by synchronizing execution of all threads on a core and then
-writing to the ACTIVATE_SCAN MSR on all threads. Instruction execution
-continues when:
-
-1) All tests have completed.
-2) Execution was interrupted.
-3) A test detected a problem.
-
-In all cases reading the SCAN_STATUS MSR provides details on what
-happened. Interrupted tests may be restarted.
-
-The IFS driver provides interfaces from /sys to control execution:
-
-Run tests on all cores::
-
-  # echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/ifs/run_test
-
-Scans run on each core sequentially by logical CPU number (when HT is
-enabled this only runs the tests once for each core).
-
-Test a single core::
-
-  # echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/ifs/run_test
-
-Results of the tests are also provided in /sys::
-
-  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/ifs/status
-  pass
-
-global status. Shows the most serious status across
-all cores (fail > untested > pass)
-
-There are files showing which CPUs are in each of the
-pass/untested/fail states::
-
-  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/ifs/cpu_fail_list
-  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/ifs/cpu_untested_list
-  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/ifs/cpu_pass_list
-  0-127
-
-Also files in the per-CPU directories showing the status
-of the most recent test on that core::
-
-  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/ifs/status
-  pass
-  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/ifs/details
-  8081
-
-The details file reports the hex value of the SCAN_STATUS MSR.  Note that
-the error_code field may contain driver defined software code not defined
-in the Intel SDM.
-
-Current driver limitations
---------------------------
-
-1) The ACTIVATE_SCAN MSR allows for running any consecutive subrange or
-available tests. But the driver always tries to run all tests and only
-uses the subrange feature to restart an interrupted test.
-
-2) Hardware allows for some number of cores to be tested in parallel.
-The driver does not make use of this, it only tests one core at a time.
-
-Tunable Parameters
-------------------
-
-This module accepts two tunable parameters. These could be provided at
-load time or can be modified at runtime through module parameter.
-(/sys/module/ifs/parameters/<parameter_name>). The parameters are as
-described below.
-
-1. noint: When set, system interrupts are not allowed to interrupt an ifs.
-2. retry: Maximum retry counter when the test is not executed due to an event such as interrupt.
